Brazilian Utils is an organization that provides utility libraries designed to
validate, generate, and handle data according to Brazilian standards ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·.

Our mission is to democratize access to information and provide tools that help anyone
create, understand, and work with Brazilian systems.

We have a repository for each programming language, following clear and consistent standards,
so you can use our utilities easily and reliably.

If you want to get in touch about anything â€” whether to create a new repository,
contribute ideas, or ask questions â€” write to: **cumbucadev@brazilian-utils.com.br**.
